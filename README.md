This repository has my code developed during [@42rio](https://42.rio/) C bootcamp (also known as piscine).

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students 
(peer-to-peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process.
The so-called ‚ÄúPiscine‚Äù, a 26-day C programming bootcamp, is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a ‚Äúcadet‚Äù (42‚Äôs student). üöÄüë©‚Äçüíª
